# Mixed Messages - Lacrosse Player Generator
First little project in the full-stack engineer career path from [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/). Generates a string with a lacrosse player's name, position and number. Each of those properties is randomly generated from arrays stored locally. 

## Setup
To run this program:

`node laxplayer.js`

## Sample output

` Aidan Andres Alvarez`
` Position: Middie`
` Number: 42`

## Sources
The first and middle name arrays come from a list of the most popular names in the US from 2000 to 2009 [according to the social security administration](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/decades/names2000s.html).

The last name array comes from [this site](https://www.thoughtco.com/most-common-us-surnames-1422656);
